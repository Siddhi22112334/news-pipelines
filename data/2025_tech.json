          "“We think that this ability to simulate the world is broadly useful beyond entertainment, even though entertainment is an ever increasing and big area for us,” Germanidis said.",
          "“It makes it much more scalable and cost effective to train [robotic] policies that interact with the real world whether that’s in robotics or in self driving.”\nGermanidis said working with robotics and self-driving car companies was not something Runway initially envisioned when it launched back in 2018.",
          "It wasn’t until robotics and other companies in other industries reached out, that the company realized their models had much broader use cases than they originally thought, he said.",
          "Robotics companies are using Runway’s tech for training simulations, Germanidis said.",
          "He added that just training robots and self-driving cars in real-world scenarios is costly for companies, takes a long time, and is hard to scale."
