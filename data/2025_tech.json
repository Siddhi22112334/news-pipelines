          "The new version, called Dolby Vision 2, has new “Content Intelligence” tools that use AI to automatically optimize your TV based on what you’re watching, where you’re watching it, and what device you’re on, expanding on the existing Dolby Vision IQ features.",

          "That’s a heavy claim, and one that we will need to see in action ourselves to judge.",
          "Hisense will become the first brand to launch TVs with Dolby Vision 2 on board, powered by a MediaTek Pentonic 800 chip.",
          "In an emailed response to questions from The Verge, Dolby spokesperson Cairon Armstrong said Dolby Vision content will still work with TVs that support either spec, but only Dolby Vision 2 capable displays will recognize and use the additional metadata if it’s present."

          "“Around 2,000 wax worms can break down an entire polyethylene bag in as little as 24 hours, although we believe that co-supplementation with feeding stimulants like sugars can reduce the number of worms considerably,” said Dr Bryan Cassone, a professor of biology at Brandon University in Canada, in a news release.",
          "They found that as the wax worms ate the polyethylene, their feces liquefied and contained glycol as a byproduct.",
          "The team also isolated bacteria from the guts of wax worms and then cultured strains that could survive on polyethylene as their sole food source.",
          "Among them was a strain of Acinetobacter, which survived for more than a year in the laboratory environment and continued to break down polyethylene.",
          "But researchers believe that creating a food source to assist their intake of polyethylene would mean wax worms are able to sustain healthy viability on a plastic diet and improve their decomposition efficiency.",
          "In the insect-rearing route, a byproduct would be large amounts of insect biomass—countless larvae that have been fed on plastic."
