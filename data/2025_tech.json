          "“As the world’s most advanced and versatile exascale system, it represents a unique innovation, opening up completely new possibilities for science and industry in Europe.”\n“With JUPITER, Europe gains its most advanced AI supercomputer, built for large-scale simulation and AI, powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.",
          "“JUPITER fuses high-performance computing and AI into a single architecture.",
          "A platform for next-generation scientific computing, it will accelerate breakthroughs across every domain — from modeling climate and renewable energy to advancing quantum research, designing new materials and building digital twins.”\nJUPITER’s ribbon-cutting ceremony was attended by a slew of Europe’s AI and industry leaders, politicians, researchers and others.",
          "JUPITER, which stands for “Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,” gives European startups, enterprises and researchers a massive leap in computing power so they can quickly, efficiently create breakthroughs in:\nFor example, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is using JUPITER to simulate climate predictions with a spatial resolution of about 1 kilometer, depicting extreme weather events such as violent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall much more realistically than before."
