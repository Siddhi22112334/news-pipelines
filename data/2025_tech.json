              "Over the next two years, filmmaker Brian Rose — who has already spent five years working to digitally reconstruct Welles’ original vision — plans to use that model to remake the lost footage from “The Magnificent Ambersons.”\nRemarkably, Fable has not obtained the rights to the film, making this a prospective tech demo that will probably never be released to the general public.",
