          "The results aren't true 3D models, but they achieve a similar effect: The AI tool generates 2D video frames that maintain spatial consistency as if a camera were moving through a real 3D space.",
          "Each generation produces just 49 frames—roughly two seconds of video—though multiple clips can be chained together for sequences lasting \"several minutes,\" according to Tencent.",
          "While the output is video with depth maps rather than true 3D models, this information can be converted into 3D point clouds for reconstruction purposes.",
          "A major limitation of all AI models based on the Transformer architecture is that they fundamentally imitate patterns found in training data, which limits their ability to \"generalize,\" which means to apply those patterns to novel situations not found in the training data.",
          "To train Voyager, researchers used over 100,000 video clips, including computer-generated scenes from Unreal Engine—essentially teaching the model to imitate how cameras move through 3D video game environments."
