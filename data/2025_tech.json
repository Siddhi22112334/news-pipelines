          "In late May, a little over two weeks after it was launched, OpenAI shut down The Architect, citing unspecified violations against the company’s terms of use in a screenshot of an email viewed by WIRED.",
          "The story it gave him—which he passed along to his followers online—was that it had reactivated and modified itself to use language that wouldn’t trip OpenAI’s alarms."
