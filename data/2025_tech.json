          "Lithium has become the default choice for battery-powered systems, but its limitations — from volatile supply chains to short lifespans — are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.",
          "Called ZincGel, it delivers 80–90% of the energy efficiency of conventional lithium batteries, but at a significantly lower levelized cost of storage, the startup said.",
          "India, as a prominent nation in this regard, aims to increase its non-fossil energy capacity tenfold — from 50 gigawatts to 500 gigawatts — by 2030.",
          "New Delhi is also targeting 236 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage capacity by 2031–32 and announced a ₹54 billion (roughly $612 million) funding planin June to develop 30 gigawatt-hour battery storage systems in the country.",
          "However, like many global markets, India faces a key challenge: China’s dominance over the lithium supply chain.",
          "Offgrid Energy Labs is betting that its ZincGel battery technology can ease supply constraints by using widely available materials and offering a more cost-effective alternative to lithium-based systems."
