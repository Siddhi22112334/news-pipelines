          "Disney will pay $10 million to settle FTC claim it used cartoons to collect YouTube data on kids\nYouTube previously faced its own settlement over alleged children’s privacy violations.",
          "The FTC alleges that Disney failed to label some videos of its popular kids cartoons it uploaded to YouTube as “Made for Kids” — a designation that makes such videos ineligible for certain features, like the collection of personal information.",
          "Disney should have known that some of its videos were marked incorrectly, the government alleges, since YouTube already told Disney in 2020 that it was labeling its videos incorrectly, changing the labels on over 300 of its videos from “Not Made for Kids” to “Made for Kids” at that time, according to the complaint.",
          "Under the proposed settlement, Disney will pay a $10 million civil settlement, obtain parents’ consent for collecting data from kids under 13 as required by law, and create a new program to review whether videos uploaded to YouTube should be marked as made for kids or not which it must maintain for the next ten years — unless YouTube comes up with its own system “to determine the age, age range, or age category of all YouTube users.” If so, Disney will no longer need its own system to figure out how videos should be labeled.",
