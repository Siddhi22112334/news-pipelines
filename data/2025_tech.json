          "“If you buy a bulb today and pair it with one you bought 10 years ago, they’ll produce the exact color match, which is not something you find on most of our competitors.”\nThis level of precision makes Hue products more complex to produce, contributing to their higher cost.",

          "A direct embrace of Matter\nAll new Hue bulbs will also support Matter-over-Thread, allowing them to pair directly with Matter ecosystems, including Apple Home, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa, without requiring a Hue Bridge."
