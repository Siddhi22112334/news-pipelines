          "The move will \"help America defend and dominate the high frontier,\" Trump said.",
          "It also marks another twist on a contentious issue that has pitted Colorado and Alabama against one another in a fight for the right to be home to the permanent headquarters of Space Command (SPACECOM), a unified combatant command responsible for carrying out military operations in space.",
          "The newest armed service, established in 2019 during President Trump's first term, is part of the Department of the Air Force, which also had the authority for recommending where to base Space Command's permanent headquarters.",
          "Military officials in the first Trump administration considered potential sites in Colorado, Florida, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas before the Air Force recommended basing Space Command in Huntsville, Alabama, on January 13, 2021, a week before Trump left office."
