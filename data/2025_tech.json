              "OpenAI is reorganizing its Model Behavior team, a small but influential group of researchers who shape how the company’s AI models interact with people, TechCrunch has learned.",
              "In an August memo to staff seen by TechCrunch, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said the Model Behavior team — which consists of roughly 14 researchers — would be joining the Post Training team, a larger research group responsible for improving the company’s AI models after their initial pre-training.",
              "As part of the changes, the Model Behavior team will now report to OpenAI’s Post Training lead Max Schwarzer.",
              "An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed these changes to TechCrunch.",
              "In an interview with TechCrunch, Jang says she’s building out a new research team called OAI Labs, which will be responsible for “inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.”\nThe Model Behavior team has become one of OpenAI’s key research groups, responsible for shaping the personality of the company’s AI models and for reducing sycophancy — which occurs when AI models simply agree with and reinforce user beliefs, even unhealthy ones, rather than offering balanced responses.",
              "The team has also worked on navigating political bias in model responses and helped OpenAI define its stance on AI consciousness."
