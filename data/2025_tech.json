              "Featuring a new round design, a self-cleaning roller mop, lidar navigation, and Dyson’s first multifunctional dock, the Spot+Scrub also comes with an “AI” moniker because it’s 2025 and doesn’t everything?",
              "First look: Dyson’s Spot+Scrub Ai robot seeks out stains\nDyson’s first robot vacuum and mop is big but not particularly bold.",
              "I didn’t get to test the Spot+Scrub or see its stain-targeting feature in action, but my time with it didn’t convince me that Dyson has finally cracked the robot vacuum code.",
              "The headline feature is AI-powered stain detection, and despite the buzzword, this idea does appear to address one of the biggest problems with robot mops — that they don’t do as good a job as manual mops."
