          "Discovery has filed a lawsuit against popular AI image generator Midjourney, accusing it of stealing and exploiting its intellectual properties.",
          "The complaint revolves around the AI tool's ability to generate images and videos of Warner Bros.' popular fictional characters, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Scooby Doo, Bugs Bunny and his friends from Looney Tunes.",
          "It said that the image generator sells a commercial subscription service powered by AI technology that was illegally trained using its copyrighted works.",
          "It apparently refused to generate videos based on Warner Bros.' properties when it first launched its video model.",
          "But within the past couple of weeks, it allegedly removed those protections and told its users that they would encounter \"fewer blocked jobs.\" The ability to generate Warner Bros.' characters are a clear draw for its subscription service that costs $10 to $120 a month, the media conglomerate said.",
          "\"It is hard to imagine copyright infringement that is any more willful than what Midjourney is doing here,\" the plaintiff added."
