          "Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled architecture, JUPITER can run 1 quintillion FP64 operations per second and is expected to offer up to 90 exaflops of AI performance, delivering more than double the speed for high-performance computing and AI workloads compared with the next-fastest system in Europe.",
          "“JUPITER marks the culmination of more than a decade of research and development,” said Thomas Lippert, director of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre.",
          "“As the world’s most advanced and versatile exascale system, it represents a unique innovation, opening up completely new possibilities for science and industry in Europe.”\n“With JUPITER, Europe gains its most advanced AI supercomputer, built for large-scale simulation and AI, powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.",
          "“JUPITER fuses high-performance computing and AI into a single architecture.",
          "A platform for next-generation scientific computing, it will accelerate breakthroughs across every domain — from modeling climate and renewable energy to advancing quantum research, designing new materials and building digital twins.”\nJUPITER’s ribbon-cutting ceremony was attended by a slew of Europe’s AI and industry leaders and Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who highlighted how the supercomputer is driving national advancement and industrial innovation.",
          "JUPITER, which stands for “Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,” gives European startups, enterprises and researchers a massive leap in computing power so they can quickly, efficiently create breakthroughs in:\nFor example, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is using JUPITER to simulate climate predictions with a spatial resolution of about 1 kilometer, depicting extreme weather events such as violent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall much more realistically than before."
