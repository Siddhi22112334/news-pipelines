          "Timekettle’s new translation earbuds are made for sharing\nThe W4 AI Interpreter Earbuds use a mic and bone conduction sensor to improve the accuracy of its voice recognition.",
          "Available now for $349 in navy blue and sandy gold color options, the earbuds are a more affordable alternative to the company’s $449 over-the-ear W4 Pro released earlier this year that looked like the clunky Bluetooth headsets that were popular a few decades ago.",
          "Timekettle says its new W4 AI are instead “optimized for casual use” with a design that looks more like modern wireless earbuds, but with a much larger stem.",
          "The reason the W4 AI aren’t as compact as other wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods is because they contain additional electronics to run Timekettle’s Babel OS 2.0 real-time translation software that’s powered by AI LLM models.",
          "As with the W4 Pro, you can also create your own custom lexicon for the new W4 AI so it doesn’t get confused when talking to someone about skibidi toilets."
