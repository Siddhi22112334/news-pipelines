              "The commission found that Google had violated European Union antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services.",
              "Specifically, the commission said Google “abused” its “dominant positions” by favoring its ad exchange AdX in both its publisher ad server and in its ad-buying tools.",
              "The commission also said Google has 60 days to “bring these self-preferencing practices to an end” and “to implement measures to cease its inherent conflicts of interest along the adtech supply chain.”\n“Google must now come forward with a serious remedy to address its conflicts of interest, and if it fails to do so, we will not hesitate to impose strong remedies,” said Teresa Ribera, the commission’s executive vice president for clean, just and competitive transition, in a statement.",
              "“Digital markets exist to serve people and must be grounded in trust and fairness.",
              "And when markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power.”\nIn response, a Google spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal that the company would appeal the commission’s decision, adding, “There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before.”\nThe WSJ reports that the announcement was delayed from a planned date of September 1, reportedly due to concerns over the European Union and United States’ continuing negotiations over a potential trade deal.",
              "This is the EU’s second largest antitrust fine ever (behind a $5 billion fine against Google in 2018)."
